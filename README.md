Dears Sir Frederic,

Yesterday I attended to a meeting in the hotel where you work and it has come to my attention that I forgot some important documents there.

Despite the fact that I was in the auditorium the whole meeting, I believe that I left the papers on the sits near the stage. Additionally, the chair has my name Gustavo Vladmovich therefore; it should help you find exactly where I was located. I have written all what was talked in this meeting and I should present a briefly summary of the discussion with all the information to my boss otherwise I can lose my job.  

I live far from hotel and due my work I cannot go during the lunch time thus I would like that you bring the annotations to the receptionist and instruct her that I will be going there on Saturday by early morning to take them. I hope you can find the papers.

Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Your Faithfully,
Gustavo Vladmovich
