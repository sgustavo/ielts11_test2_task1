Dears Sir Frederic,

Yesterday I attended to a meeting in the hotel where you work and it has come to my attention that I forgot some important documents there.
Despite the fact that I was in the auditorium the whole meeting, I believe that I left the papers on the sits near the stage. Additionally, the chair has my name Gustavo Vladmovich therefore; it should help you find where I have been located.
